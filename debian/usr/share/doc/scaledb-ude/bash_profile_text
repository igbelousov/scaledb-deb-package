Thanks for using ScaleDB ONE 16.01!
Please note this is a preview and it should not be used in production.

=== Technical Notes:
MariaDB 10 is installed in /usr/local/mysql
The data directory is /usr/local/mysql/data
The configuration file (my.cnf) is in the base directory
ScaleDB ONE 16.01 is installed in /usr/local/ScaleDB
The configuration files (cas.cnf and slm.cnf are in the base directory)
The ScaleDB configuration engine (scaledb.cnf) is in the data directory

=== Two important commands:
scaledb_one [start/stop]
- This command restarts ScaleDB ONE. It is a wrapper for the single
  starters, scaledb_cas, scaledb_slm and scaledb_mariadb
scaledb_test
- This commands executes a Python script that will provide an indication
  of the performance of ScaleDB compared to InnoDB. InnoDB buffer pool and
  ScaleDB cache should be modified to increase performance.
