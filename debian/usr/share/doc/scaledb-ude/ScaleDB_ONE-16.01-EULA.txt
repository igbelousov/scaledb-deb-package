END USER SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS SCALEDB SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") GOVERNS THE INSTALLATION
AND USE OF THE SCALEDB SOFTWARE DESCRIBED HEREIN. YOU WILL BE REQUIRED
TO INDICATE YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD
THE SOFTWARE, REGISTER THE SOFTWARE WITH SCALEDB AND TO INSTALL AND OPERATE
THE SOFTWARE. BY CLICKING ON THE "YES" BUTTON, CHECKBOX OR OTHER BUTTON OR
MECHANISM DESIGNED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF AN ELECTRONIC COPY
OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR DOWNLOADING OR INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE, OR USING ANY MEDIA
THAT CONTAINS THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. THIS AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE
AGAINST ANY PERSON OR ENTITY THAT USES THE SOFTWARE AND ANY PERSON OR ENTITY
THAT USES THE SOFTWARE ON ANOTHER PERSON'S OR ENTITY'S BEHALF. YOU AGREE THAT
THIS AGREEMENT IS EQUIVALENT TO ANY WRITTEN NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT SIGNED BY YOU.
IF YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A BUSINESS OR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY,
DEPARTMENT OR INSTRUMENTALITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE AUTHORITY
TO BIND THAT BUSINESS TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND YOUR AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS WILL
BE TREATED AS THE AGREEMENT OF THE BUSINESS. IN THAT EVENT, "YOU" AND "YOUR"
REFER HEREIN TO THAT BUSINESS.
THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE UPDATED BY SCALEDB FROM TIME TO TIME.

1. DEFINITIONS.
  1.1 “Applications” means computer software products that interface with
      the Software, either directly or through third-party software such as
      MySQL or MariaDB.
  1.2 “Excluded Causes” means (a) any modification, reconfiguration, or
      maintenance of the Software performed by any party other than ScaleDB;
      (b) any use of the Software on a system that does not meet ScaleDB’s
      minimum standards for such Software, including use on a modified or
      unsupported operating system or environment (c) any hardware or
      non-ScaleDB software; (d) failure to implement all Updates issued
      by ScaleDB; (e) use of the Software in a manner for which it was not
      designed; and/or (f) accident, negligence, or misuse of the Software.
  1.3 “Software” means the ScaleDB ONE Version 16.01 software, in object code
      form, plus any related documentation, scripts, or complementary
      applications and any subsequent software releases provided to You under
      this Agreement.
  1.4 “Cluster” means a set of components of the Software, running on multiple
      machines, virtual machines, containers or cloud images, networked together
      to form a database system. Replicating from an instance of Software to
      another instance of Software solely for purposes of providing failover to
      the master instance, does not constitute a Cluster.
  1.5 “Support” has the meaning described in Exhibit B.
  1.6 “Update” means a new generally-released version of the Software
      designated, in ScaleDB’s sole discretion, with a version number changed
      to the right or the left of the first decimal point.

2. LICENSES.
  2.1 License to Software.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, ScaleDB grants to You a nonexclusive license to use all the
      components of the Software on only one machine, virtual machine,
      container or cloud image. This license is granted to You to operate
      Software on your own hardware or a third party’s computing
      infrastructure. Use of the Software components to form a cluster on
      additional machines, or virtual machines, containers or cloud images,
      requires a license to ScaleDB Cluster, a different product that is not
      licensed under this agreement. Use of Software beyond the above licensed
      uses, or on more than one instance, or running on more than one machine,
      or virtual machine, container or cloud image to form a cluster, shall be
      considered a material breach of this Agreement.
  2.2 Restrictions.  Unless explicitly noted, ScaleDB’s license grants are not
      transferable, assignable, or sublicenseable.   You shall not, nor shall
      You permit a third party to, decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble
      the Software’s source code or attempt to discover any portion of the
      source code or any trade secrets with respect to the Software. Further,
      You shall not, nor shall You allow a third-party to, combine, repackage,
      or bundle Software with any other software or hardware that violates the
      terms of the other software or hardware license. ScaleDB and its licensors
      retain all rights, title, and interest in and to all intellectual property
      rights embodied in or associated with the Software.  There are no implied
      licenses under this Agreement (by implication, estoppel, or otherwise),
      and any rights not expressly granted to You under this Agreement are
      reserved by ScaleDB or its licensors.

3. WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.
  3.1 Performance Warranty.  ScaleDB does not warrant that operation of the
      Software will be uninterrupted, secure, or error free, or that all errors
      will be corrected.  ScaleDB further does not warrant that the information
      stored or transmitted by the Software is free from unauthorized
      modification.
  3.2 Disclaimer.  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 3, SCALEDB AND
      ITS LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
      OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
      NONINFRINGEMENT.  Each party acknowledges that it has not entered into
      this Agreement in reliance upon any warranty or representation except
      those specifically set forth herein.

4. TERM AND TERMINATION.
  4.1 Term.  This Agreement shall commence upon Your approval of this Agreement,
      or the download or installation of Software, and shall continue in force
      until terminated.  By providing written notice, either party may terminate
      this Agreement upon the material breach of the other party of the terms of
      this Agreement, if such default continues for 30 days after written
      notice.
  4.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination of this Agreement, all license
      rights granted under this Agreement immediately terminate, except as
      expressly specified otherwise. The provisions of Sections 1, 2.2, 3, 4.2,
      5.2, 6, and 7 and Your obligation to pay any owed but unpaid amounts,
      shall survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

5. INDEMNITY.
  5.1 ScaleDB’s Indemnity.  ScaleDB may defend or settle any claims that You may
      incur that arise out of infringement by the Software of any copyright,
      trade secret, or U.S. patent right existing or issued as of the date that
      ScaleDB initially provided the applicable Software version or release.
      ScaleDB may, at its option and expense (in addition to fulfilling its
      indemnity obligations above): (a) replace the Software with substantially
      equivalent Software that could not reasonably infringe; (b) modify
      the Software so that it no longer could reasonably infringe but remains
      substantially equivalent; (c) obtain for You the right to continue its
      license rights to the Software; or (d) if none of the foregoing is
      reasonably available, terminate Your license to such Software.
      ScaleDB will not be liable for claims based upon: (a) the use or
      combination of the Software with Software, hardware, or other materials
      not provided by ScaleDB if infringement would not have occurred in
      the absence of such combination; (b) any marking or branding not applied
      by ScaleDB (or at the request of an authorized ScaleDB employee);
      or (c) any use of an altered or modified version of the Software if
      infringement would not have occurred but for the alteration
      or modification.  THIS SECTION STATES SCALEDB’S AND ITS LICENSORS’ SOLE
      AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.
  5.2 Your Indemnity. You may defend or settle any claims which ScaleDB or its
      licensors may incur that arise out of the Applications (excluding
      the Software) or Your acts, omissions, misrepresentations, or failure
      to comply with applicable laws or regulations, and You shall indemnify
      ScaleDB and its licensors for all claims, losses, costs, damages,
      and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, attributable to any
      final judgment or settlement based on such claims.
  5.3 Mechanics of Indemnity.  The foregoing indemnity obligations are
      conditioned on the party seeking indemnification
      (the “Indemnified Party”): (a) giving the proposed indemnifier
      (the “Indemnifying Party”) notice of the relevant claim, (b) cooperating
      with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense,
      in the defense of such claim, and (c) giving the Indemnifying Party
      the right to control the defense and settlement of any such claim, except
      that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement that
      affects the Indemnified Party’s rights or interest without the Indemnified
      Party’s prior written approval.  The Indemnified Party shall have
      the right to participate in the defense at its expense.

6. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.
  6.1 EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF SECTION 2 OR YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY
      WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY
      (OR SCALEDB’S LICENSORS) BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
      WITH THIS AGREEMENT (HOWEVER ARISING, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), EVEN IF
      SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE
      OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY HEREIN.
  6.2 EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF SECTION 2, OR YOUR FAILURE
      TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER
      PARTY’S LIABILITY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE LICENSE FEES
      ACTUALLY PAID TO SCALEDB BY YOU.

7. GENERAL.
  7.1 Governing Law.  This Agreement will be governed by California law without
      regard to conflict of laws or principles.  Both parties submit to personal
      jurisdiction in California and agree that any cause of action arising
      under this Agreement must be brought in a federal or state court having
      within its venue San Mateo County, California.
  7.2 Assignment.  Neither party may assign its rights or delegate its duties
      under this Agreement without the other party’s prior written consent,
      except that a party may assign its rights and delegate its duties
      (in whole, but not in part) to an assignee who buys or is transferred all
      or substantially all the party’s assets or equity, unless the assignee is
      reasonably deemed a direct competitor of the other party.  Any attempted
      assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing shall be void.
      The parties’ rights and obligations will bind and inure to the benefit
      of their respective successors and permitted assigns.
  7.3 Severability; Waiver.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
      invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will
      continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way.
      The parties agree to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision
      which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of
      the invalid provision.  The waiver by either party of a breach of any
      provision of this Agreement will not operate or be interpreted as a waiver
      of any other or subsequent breach.
  7.4 Force Majeure.  If performance of this Agreement, or any obligation under
      this Agreement (other than the making of payments), is interfered with by
      any act or condition beyond the reasonable control of the affected party,
      the party so affected, upon giving prompt notice to the other party, will
      be excused from such performance to the extent of such condition.
  7.5 Government License.  If the License is being acquired by or on behalf of
      the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or
      subcontractor (at any tier), in accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-4
      (for Department of Defense acquisitions) and 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212
      (for non-Department of Defense acquisitions), the government's rights in
      such code and any documentation, including its rights to use, modify,
      reproduce, release, perform, display or disclose such code or
      documentation, will be subject in all respects to the license rights and
      restrictions provided in this Agreement.
  7.6 Independent Contractors.  The parties to this Agreement are independent
      contractors, and no agency, partnership, joint venture,
      or franchisor-franchisee relationship is intended or created by
      this Agreement.
  7.7 Notice.  Any notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be
      given via the email address provided by You or at such other address as a
      You shall specify in writing.  Notice shall be deemed given within 8 hours
      of sending the appropriate email.
  7.8 Entire Agreement and Amendment.  This Agreement and the attached Exhibits
      set forth the entire understanding and agreement of the parties,
      and supersede any and all oral or written agreements or understandings
      between the parties as to the subject matter of this Agreement.
      This Agreement shall control over any conflicting provisions of
      any purchase order or other similar business form, and such conflicting
      provisions are expressly rejected.  In the event of any conflict between
      the Agreement and an Exhibit, the terms of the Exhibit shall control.
      This Agreement may be updated by ScaleDB from time to time.
